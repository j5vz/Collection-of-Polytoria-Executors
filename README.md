# Collection of Polytoria Executors
Hello! I've made this repository to make everyone have free access (or with no hassle) for Polytoria executors!
I do not embrace exploiting nor hacking, this repository simply gives the products for such things.

# How do some of these work?
For example: some executors such as Elytra uses DLL injection. You can easily find tutorials on YouTube, Google or simply by asking AI about what an DLL injection is. It really is simple, some of you just don't know how to do it.

# Will i get banned for using these?
Of course, that's a stupid question.
Executors in general (Roblox executors, Roblox Revival executors, etc.) can cause bans no matter what. Only Roblox gives us an exception, where you can exploit in your own game.

# What are the most reccomended executors?
Me personally, i'd reccomend either Elytra or Synapse X as they are the best ones, as far as i know. I know that Scamnapse made Synapse X (Polytoria executor) and clearly has shitty code, but it is easy to use and has somewhat good looking UI for a Publix product.
