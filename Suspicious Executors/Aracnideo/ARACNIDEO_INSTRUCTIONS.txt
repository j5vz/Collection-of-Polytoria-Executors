How can i use Aracnideo? Well, you're in the right file.
Due to github not letting us upload more than 25mb on their site, we have to rely on Aracnideo's own repository.

Paste one of the 3 links below on your Browser's URL bar:
https://github.com/arocimorr/Aracnideo-Executor/releases/download/Aracedeo/AracnideoExecutorUPDATED.exe
https://github.com/arocimorr/Aracnideo-Executor/releases/download/Aracedeo/AracnideoExecutorLATEST.exe
https://github.com/arocimorr/Aracnideo-Executor/releases/download/Aracedeo/AracnideoExecutor.exe

After you paste the link, your download should begin and be down soon. The file is as big as 135MB.
Contact @j5vz on Discord for any issues.
