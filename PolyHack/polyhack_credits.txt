POLYHACK CREDITS
THANKS TO FOENEM LEAKING POLYHACK

ElCapoto has made this executor sometime after Polytoria has gotten popular (around 12th of february or so). PolyHack is considered the first executor in Polytoria history.
The Team behind PolyHack is notoriously known for being lazy and huge. As an example, Elytra was made by one person, meanwhile PolyHack was made by 10.
